# Modelling astrophysical time series with physics-based deep learning

Material for the workshop "Modelling astrophysical time series with physics-based deep learning" hosted in the session ["Machine Learning Methods for Research in Astrophysics" of the NAM2021 conference](https://nam2021.org/science/parallel-sessions/details/2/75) 

To open the notebook in google Colab, follow [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mariomorvan/nam21-astro-ts-physics-dl/blob/main/NAM2021_workshop_astro_ts_physics_dl.ipynb) (requires a google account to be executed).
From there you can run it directly in read-mode, save a copy of in your own Colab directory or alternatively, you could clone this repo and open the notebook locally with Jupyter notebook.
